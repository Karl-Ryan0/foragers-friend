        On the map, there are various icons that will point you to locations nearby, as well as any warnings you might
        need. At the moment there are only categories for
        blackberries, nettles and strawberries, but more will be added in the future!

        You can use the form below to submit a request for a new item type to be added, however I will not be adding mushrooms
        due to the dangers involved with mushrooms.
